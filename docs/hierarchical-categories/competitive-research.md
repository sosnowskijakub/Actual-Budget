# Hierarchical Categories: Competitive Research & Market Analysis

**Author:** johnn27 (community contributor)  
**Research Date:** August 2025  
**Scope:** Personal finance app category hierarchy implementations and user demand analysis  
**Purpose:** Validate implementation approach for Actual Budget hierarchical categories feature

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** Hierarchical categories represent a significant market opportunity with strong user demand and competitive gaps in popular personal finance applications.

**Market Gap:** Leading apps (YNAB, Credit Karma) lack comprehensive hierarchy support despite active user requests, while best-in-class implementation (PocketSmith) demonstrates proven patterns for success.

**Recommendation:** Implement hierarchical categories using PocketSmith's "container-based" approach with unlimited nesting and roll-up analytics.

## Competitive Analysis

### 🏆 PocketSmith (Best-in-Class Implementation)

**Hierarchy Approach:**

- **Unlimited nesting levels** with multiple creation methods
- **Container-based budgeting**: Parent categories organize, children get budgets
- **Roll-up analytics**: Consolidated parent-level insights with detail drill-down
- **Three creation methods**: Hyphen notation, drag-drop, settings dropdown

**Technical Implementation Details:**

```typescript
// Database Structure
{
  id: string,
  parent_id: string | null,
  title: string,
  colour: string,
  is_transfer: boolean,
  roll_up: boolean,
  children: CategoryEntity[]
}

// Creation Methods
1. Hyphen notation: "food-groceries-organic" (3 levels max)
2. Drag & drop: Visual hierarchy manipulation (unlimited depth)
3. Settings editor: Traditional dropdown parent selection
```

**Budgeting Logic:**

- **Core Philosophy**: Parent categories are containers, not budget targets
- **Budget Assignment**: Only child (leaf) categories receive budgets
- **Roll-up Calculations**: Parent shows consolidated totals for analysis
- **Best Practice**: "Never budget at parent level" - official recommendation

**UI/UX Patterns:**

- **Visual hierarchy**: Clean indentation with depth indicators
- **Roll-up toggles**: Clickable arrows to show/hide consolidated view
- **Color coding**: Full spectrum beyond traditional red/green
- **Consistent behavior**: Roll-up state synchronized across all views

**User Feedback:**

- **Positive**: Flexibility and unlimited depth praised by users
- **Learning curve**: Initial complexity for new users
- **Performance**: Generally good, some reports slower with deep nesting

### 📉 YNAB (Major Competitive Gap)

**Current Limitations:**

- **2-level hierarchy only**: Category Groups → Categories (no subcategories)
- **No subcategory support**: Fundamental architectural limitation
- **Active user requests**: Community actively requesting deeper hierarchy

**User Demand Evidence:**

```
"Users want 'umbrella' categories for broad budget areas, with clear
'subcategories' within them, requesting the ability to logically group
these together in the UI and see running totals for subcategories
similar to full categories"
```

**Community Feedback:**

- **GitHub Issues**: Multiple toolkit requests for subcategory functionality
- **Common Use Cases**: Income subcategories for tax planning, event planning with related categories
- **Workarounds**: Users creating artificial "category groups" to simulate hierarchy

**Market Opportunity:**

- **Large user base**: YNAB has significant market share
- **Unmet need**: Users actively seeking alternatives with hierarchy support
- **Feature gap**: No timeline for addressing subcategory requests

### 💀 Credit Karma (Post-Mint Disaster)

**Massive Downgrade from Mint:**

- **Pre-migration**: Mint had 2-level hierarchy with customizable subcategories
- **Post-migration**: Credit Karma offers only 26 fixed categories
- **No customization**: Cannot create, rename, or organize categories
- **User exodus**: Migration created significant user dissatisfaction

**User Impact:**

```
"Credit Karma is NOT a good alternative to Mint – the budgeting
features are just too basic and nothing close to what Mint offers"
```

**Market Opportunity:**

- **Displaced users**: Mint refugees seeking hierarchy functionality
- **Feature vacuum**: Major downgrade created demand for alternatives
- **Timing**: Recent migration (2024) means users actively searching

### 🔧 Other Apps Analysis

**Tiller (Spreadsheet-Based):**

- **Unlimited flexibility**: Custom hierarchies possible via spreadsheet structure
- **Technical barrier**: Requires spreadsheet expertise
- **Auto-categorization**: Good transaction matching with hierarchical rules

**Simplifi:**

- **Goal-based approach**: Emphasizes automatic categorization over hierarchy
- **Minimal hierarchy**: Simple category organization without deep nesting
- **Streamlined UX**: Prioritizes simplicity over detailed organization

---

## User Demand Analysis

### Quantitative Evidence

**Actual Budget Community:**

- **Issue #1320**: 206+ thumbs up reactions for subcategory feature
- **Strong engagement**: Multi-year discussion with detailed use cases
- **Community priority**: Top-requested feature by reaction count

**Cross-Platform Requests:**

- **YNAB Community**: Active GitHub issues and forum discussions
- **Reddit r/personalfinance**: Regular posts about category organization challenges
- **Migration discussions**: Mint users specifically mentioning hierarchy loss

### Qualitative User Needs

**Common Use Cases:**

```
1. Detailed expense tracking:
   "Food ($300/month) → Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner breakdown"

2. Organizational flexibility:
   "House → Bills → Electricity, Internet, Insurance"

3. Event planning:
   "Wedding → Venue, Catering, Photography, Flowers"

4. Tax categorization:
   "Income → Salary, Freelance, Investments"

5. Family tracking:
   "Kids → School, Activities, Clothing, Healthcare"
```

**User Frustrations:**

- **Flat category limitations**: Cannot organize related expenses logically
- **Reporting gaps**: Hard to analyze spending at different levels of detail
- **Workaround complexity**: Creating artificial category schemes to simulate hierarchy
- **Migration pain**: Lost functionality when switching between apps

### Real User Quotes

**Detailed Tracking Needs:**

> "I would like to track my food spendings ($300 per month) But also
> like to be able to categorize how much I spend for each meal
> (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)"

**Organizational Requirements:**

> "house → bills → electricity, Internet, Insurance → furniture"

**Flexibility Requests:**

> "Users want umbrella categories with logical subcategories and
> running totals"

## Technical Implementation Insights

### Database Architecture Patterns

**Standard Approach (Used by PocketSmith, Actual PR #5268):**

```sql
-- Simple parent-child relationship
ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN parent_id TEXT REFERENCES categories(id);

-- Additional metadata for enhanced functionality
ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN is_container BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN display_order INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE categories ADD COLUMN color TEXT;
```

**Hierarchy Building:**

- **Client-side calculation**: Build tree structure in frontend
- **Recursive queries**: For deep hierarchy operations
- **Caching strategy**: Pre-calculate rollups for performance

### UI/UX Implementation Patterns

**Visual Hierarchy Display:**

```css
/* Indentation-based depth indication */
.category-depth-1 {
  padding-left: 20px;
}
.category-depth-2 {
  padding-left: 40px;
}
.category-depth-3 {
  padding-left: 60px;
}

/* Roll-up state indicators */
.rollup-toggle {
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

.rollup-toggle.expanded {
  transform: rotate(90deg);
}
```

**Creation UX Patterns:**

1. **Hyphen notation**: Quick text-based creation for power users
2. **Drag-drop**: Visual manipulation for most users
3. **Form-based**: Traditional dropdown selection for conservative users

### Performance Considerations

**Optimization Strategies:**

- **Lazy loading**: Load hierarchy levels on-demand
- **Calculation caching**: Pre-compute rollup values
- **Database indexing**: Optimize parent_id queries
- **Client-side caching**: Store hierarchy structure locally

**Scalability Limits:**

- **Practical depth**: Most users stay within 3-4 levels
- **Category count**: Performance tested up to 1000+ categories
- **Real-time updates**: Efficient rollup recalculation on changes
