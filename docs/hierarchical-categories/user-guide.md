# Hierarchical Categories - User Guide

## What This Means for You 🎯

**Simple version**: You can now organize categories under other categories, like having "Groceries" and "Restaurants" under "Food" - while still budgeting however you prefer.

## How It Works

### Three Ways to Use It

| Style                   | Example                                                  | Best For                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Simple Organization** | Food → Groceries, Restaurants (budget each individually) | Current users who want better organization |
| **Parent Budgeting**    | Food $800 total → spend on any Food subcategory          | Users who prefer simple totals             |
| **Mixed Budgeting**     | Food $50 misc + Groceries $400 + Restaurants $200        | Users who want both flexibility            |

### Real Examples

**Sarah's Approach (Simple):**

```
🍽️ Food (no budget - just organizes)
  ├── 🛒 Groceries          $400 budgeted
  ├── 🍕 Restaurants        $200 budgeted
  └── ☕ Coffee             $100 budgeted
```

_Same as today, just better organized!_

**Mike's Approach (Mixed):**

```
🍽️ Food                    $30 budgeted (misc food items)
  ├── 🛒 Groceries          $400 budgeted
  ├── 🍕 Restaurants        $200 budgeted
  └── ☕ Coffee             $100 budgeted
Total Food Budget: $730
```

_Handles both planned and unexpected food expenses_

## Key Benefits

- ✅ **Your existing budget stays exactly the same**
- ✅ **Better organization** without complexity
- ✅ **Start simple, add detail over time**
- ✅ **Works like regular categories** - no new concepts to learn
- ✅ **Better reports** - see spending at different levels

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this make my budget more complicated?**  
A: Only if you want it to! You can keep budgeting exactly like today and just use subcategories for better organization.

**Q: What if I don't want subcategories?**  
A: Nothing changes! This is completely optional.

**Q: How is this different from tags?**  
A: Tags are great for "How much did I spend on #kids across all categories?" Subcategories are great for "How much did I spend on different types of food?" They work well together!

## Getting Started Safely

1. **Pick one category group** (like Food) to experiment with
2. **Create a parent category** (like "Food")
3. **Move existing categories** (like Groceries, Restaurants) under it
4. **Keep your existing budgets** on the individual categories
5. **See how you like the organization** before trying other approaches

## The Bottom Line

This gives you better organization without forcing you to change how you budget. Use it as much or as little as makes sense for your finances!
