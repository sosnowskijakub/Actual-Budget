## Overview

This documentation package provides comprehensive research, analysis, and implementation planning for hierarchical categories in Actual Budget. The proposal addresses strong user demand (206+ GitHub reactions) and significant competitive opportunities in the personal finance space.

## Document Structure

### üìã [Implementation Specification](implementation-spec.md)

**Primary document** - 3-phase incremental development plan with technical details, timelines, and success criteria.

### üìä [Competitive Research](competitive-research.md)

Market analysis of personal finance apps (PocketSmith, YNAB, Credit Karma) showing user demand and implementation patterns.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è [Risk Analysis](risk-analysis.md)

Expert sub-agent reviews identifying risks around system complexity, user confusion, and competing organizational paradigms.

### üîß [Mixed Categories Approach](mixed-categories-approach.md)

Detailed technical proposal for flexible parent-child category budgeting with edge case analysis.

### üìñ [User Guide](user-guide.md)

Non-technical overview for end users explaining benefits and usage patterns.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strong Market Validation

- **206+ user reactions** on Issue #1320 requesting this feature
- **YNAB limitations**: Only 2-level hierarchy, users actively requesting more
- **Credit Karma downgrade**: Mint refugees need hierarchy functionality
- **PocketSmith success**: Proven implementation patterns with unlimited nesting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Risks

- **Competing systems**: Category Groups vs Hierarchical Categories confusion
- **User complexity**: Advanced features may overwhelm casual users
- **Technical debt**: Additional maintenance burden for open source community

### üéØ Recommended Approach

**3-Phase Incremental Implementation:**

1. **Visual Hierarchy Foundation** (2-3 weeks, LOW risk)
2. **Enhanced Creation UX** (2-3 weeks, MEDIUM risk)
3. **Advanced Analytics** (3-4 weeks, MEDIUM-HIGH risk)

## Implementation Philosophy

**Container-based budgeting** (validated by PocketSmith success):

- Parent categories = organizational containers
- Child categories = actual budgeting targets
- Roll-up analytics = consolidated insights

This approach balances flexibility with simplicity while addressing real user organizational needs.

## Community Impact

### Competitive Advantages

- **vs YNAB**: Unlimited nesting (they have 2-level only)
- **vs Credit Karma**: Full hierarchy (they have none)
- **vs PocketSmith**: Open source with same feature set
- **Open source positioning**: Modern alternative with advanced features

### Success Metrics

- User adoption rates for hierarchical categories
- Performance impact with complex category structures
- Community feedback and contribution levels
- Competitive positioning in personal finance space

## Next Steps

1. **Community review** of implementation specification
2. **Phase 1 development** - Visual hierarchy foundation
3. **User testing** and feedback incorporation
4. **Iterative development** of subsequent phases
